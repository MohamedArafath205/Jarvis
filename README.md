# Jarvis
This is a Personal assistant made by me.
To run this code in a full fledged manner follow these steps:
1. Download all the files
2. Copy the startup.vbs and paste it to the startup folder
3. Once you do that restart your computer
4. After that you can simply call "Jarvis" or "Siri"
# enjoy the code
